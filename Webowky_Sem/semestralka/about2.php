            <p>
            I don´t know yours, but this page exists so that you don´t have to search for decent, readable content on
            several dozens of different pages. The purpose is to eventually gather reference on every reputable web novel,
            web series, quest, or fanfiction author, so that you do not have to search for reccomend threads all the time.
